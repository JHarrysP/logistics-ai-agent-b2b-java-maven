Client: Hamburg Construction GmbH
Delivery: Baustelle Hafencity, Überseeallee 10, 20457 Hamburg, Germany

PICKING ROUTE (Optimized by AI):
Follow locations in this order for optimal efficiency:

Location: A-01-01
Estimated travel time: 2 minutes
1. Pick 100 x Ceramic Floor Tiles 60x60cm Premium White (SKU: TILE-001)
    FRAGILE - Handle with care, use protective packaging
    LARGE QUANTITY - Consider using pallet

Location: B-02-01
Estimated travel time: 4 minutes
2. Pick 80 x Portland Cement 50kg Bag Premium Grade (SKU: CONC-001)
    LARGE QUANTITY - Consider using pallet

LOADING SEQUENCE (AI-Optimized):
Load items in this order for optimal truck utilization:
1. Heavy construction materials first (bottom of truck)
2. Medium weight items in middle sections
3. Fragile tiles last (top, with extra protection)
4. Small items fill remaining spaces

WEIGHT ALERT: Total order weight is 6500.0kg - Ensure truck capacity and proper weight distribution

SPECIAL HANDLING REQUIRED:
- Extra care needed for fragile/heavy items
- Additional packaging materials may be required
- Consider specialized transport equipment

Estimated total picking time: 12 minutes
Order summary: 2 items, 6500.0kg, 82.00m³

Client: Hamburg Construction GmbH
Delivery: Baustelle Hafencity, Überseeallee 10, 20457 Hamburg, Germany

PICKING ROUTE (Optimized by AI):
Follow locations in this order for optimal efficiency:

Location: A-01-01
Estimated travel time: 2 minutes
1. Pick 100 x Ceramic Floor Tiles 60x60cm Premium White (SKU: TILE-001)
    FRAGILE - Handle with care, use protective packaging
    LARGE QUANTITY - Consider using pallet

Location: B-02-01
Estimated travel time: 4 minutes
2. Pick 80 x Portland Cement 50kg Bag Premium Grade (SKU: CONC-001)
    LARGE QUANTITY - Consider using pallet

LOADING SEQUENCE (AI-Optimized):
Load items in this order for optimal truck utilization:
1. Heavy construction materials first (bottom of truck)
2. Medium weight items in middle sections
3. Fragile tiles last (top, with extra protection)
4. Small items fill remaining spaces

WEIGHT ALERT: Total order weight is 6500.0kg - Ensure truck capacity and proper weight distribution

SPECIAL HANDLING REQUIRED:
- Extra care needed for fragile/heavy items
- Additional packaging materials may be required
- Consider specialized transport equipment

Estimated total picking time: 12 minutes
Order summary: 2 items, 6500.0kg, 82.00m³
